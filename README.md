Current experimental.7 runtime source delivery: https://github.com/genomez/ha-eufy-sdk-addon/releases/tag/s1-runtime-0.4.1.experimental.7

# Experimental.7 local preparation

Version `0.3.1-s1.experimental.7` is delivered with the verified experimental.7 runtime. Pair add-on `0.4.1-s1.experimental.7` and integration `0.3.1-s1.experimental.7`. Automatic floodlight correction is OFF-only and cannot re-send ON. A shared command-health gate pauses automatic writes for ten minutes after two fast correlated refusals, while explicit commands remain eligible. Includes review.14 upstream beta.73/beta.80 adaptations, RTC renewal cooldowns and passive diagnostics.

The package remains private; no npm publication is planned. Live view remains opt-in through `webrtc_relay: true`; public add-on default is false. Earlier release records below are historical.

# S1 experimental bridge source

Experimental S1/T9000 SDK host, state and media bridge source.

**Corresponding source accompanies the experimental runtime prerelease.** Read [EXPERIMENTAL.md](EXPERIMENTAL.md) for qualification evidence, known limitations and privacy requirements before using this source.

This is an independently maintained experimental branch derived from the [upstream project](https://github.com/mega-yfue/ha-eufy-sdk-bridge) and [danymexi's S1 work](https://github.com/danymexi/eufy-sdk). It is not an official upstream release. Upstream copyright and license notices are preserved.

## Experimental.6 source delivery, 2026-10-18

Version `0.3.1-s1.experimental.6` corresponding source is published. Runtime and corresponding-source release: `https://github.com/genomez/ha-eufy-sdk-addon/releases/tag/s1-runtime-0.4.1.experimental.6`. The companion integration is `0.3.1-s1.experimental.6`, paired with add-on `0.4.1-s1.experimental.6`. Update both components; relay defaults to false and command keepalive remains 29000 ms independently. Only JSON boolean true enables relay. No npm publication is planned.

The accepted Linux amd64 image passed isolated smoke checks; this exact release has no claimed physical-device, live HA/HACS installation or overnight soak acceptance. Earlier dated preparation, dev3 pairing, source-preview restrictions and implementation qualification records below are historical. Current source is the accepted review.9 RC9 package; original licenses, attribution and modification notices are preserved.

## Experimental.6 package refresh, 2026-10-17

This replaces the earlier review.7 candidate with review.9 input `681efd9` (implementation `d4335b9`, on review.8 `f6a59d9`). Runtime source is unchanged. Includes bounded pending acceptance for eligible correlated floodlight late replies with authoritative correction, supported S1 camera sirens, standard doorbell ring events and faster demand-only live-view admission, alongside the battery stream fix and native relay. The add-on relay option defaults to false; command keepalive remains 29000 independently. Package versions are SDK `0.2.1-s1.experimental.6` and bridge `0.3.1-s1.experimental.6`. Earlier candidate status statements above are historical. Original licenses and attribution remain. This is local packaging; publication and final device/soak qualification are pending.
